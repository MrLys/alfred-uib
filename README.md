A workflow that looks up words in ordbok.uib.no
========================

## Features
* Search in both nynorsk and bokm√•l, or one of them
* Copies selected result to clipboard

## Notes
Should probably be used with caution, as doing a lot of requests seems to make the request take a
lot more time. This is also seen from their webpage, and might be ddos prevention or just lack of
processing power. Either way, let's not ddos their service.
